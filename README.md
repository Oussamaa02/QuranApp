# QuranApp

The primary goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly mobile application that provides easy access to the Quran in both text and audio formats, along with other Islamic resources such as prayers, supplications, and prayer times. The app aims to support the global Muslim community in reading, learning, and understanding the Quran, while also offering tools for practicing Islam and connecting with other Muslims.
